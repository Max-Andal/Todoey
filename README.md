# todoapp

Todaey as you can see the name is todo app that have user registration and login also had a home page where you can put all your todos that day.

I used flutter and firebase for user registration and user sign-in , and I used Hive as a local database.

Your username and Name will be stored at firebase and your todos will be stored at your local mobile.

I coded this app watching along (Mitch Koko) YouTube channel and I added my touch on login and signup.

What I learned during building this app is:
1.  how to use Hive_flutter to store database on local.
2. How to use AuthStatechanges() on firebase to keep user logged in.
